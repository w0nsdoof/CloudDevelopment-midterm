# Midterm Project: Deploying a Scalable Web Application on Google Cloud Platform

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a scalable web application hosted on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
The application will utilize various GCP services, including **Google App Engine**, **Google Cloud Functions**, and **Google Cloud Endpoints**, while leveraging containerization with **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** for deployment.  
The goal is to build an application that is **responsive**, **scalable**, and **easy to maintain**.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Introduction to Google Cloud Platform

- Familiarize with GCP and its core services.
- Understand the advantages of using cloud infrastructure for web applications.

### 2. Google Cloud SDK and Cloud Shell

- Install and configure Google Cloud SDK.
- Utilize Cloud Shell for managing resources and deploying applications.

### 3. Google App Engine

- Develop a simple web application (e.g., a to-do list) using a framework like **Flask** or **Django**.
- Deploy the application on **Google App Engine**, ensuring that it can handle increased traffic.

### 4. Building with Google Cloud Functions

- Create serverless functions to handle specific tasks, such as processing user inputs or sending notifications.
- Integrate these functions with the main application.

### 5. Containerizing Applications

- Containerize the application using **Docker**.
- Deploy the containerized application on **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**.

### 6. Managing APIs with Google Cloud Endpoints

- Set up an API for the application using **Google Cloud Endpoints**.
- Implement authentication and monitoring for the API.

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write **unit tests** and **integration tests** to ensure functionality.
- Perform **load testing** to evaluate scalability.

### 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- Use Google Cloud’s **monitoring tools** to track application performance.
- Establish maintenance practices to ensure uptime and reliability.
